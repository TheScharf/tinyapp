# TinyApp Project

Have you ever been caught playing chicken with the "remaining characters" notification while writing a post or comment? How about having to reword an entire sentence because you simply have so much to say and not enough space to say it? Well, allow me to introduce...**TinyApp!**

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Now you can choose your words carefully, for the right reasons.
